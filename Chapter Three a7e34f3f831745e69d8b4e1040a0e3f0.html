As she sees it, the fal&#x27;Cie not only made them into l&#x27;Cie, it also took her sister from her. The former soldier could never bring herself to meekly follow the orders of such a being, and Snow&#x27;s apparent surrender to its will, however misinterpreted, is more than she can stand.</p><p id="58a67dc2-ddf4-44a9-8dd0-0c145521d059" class="">As they trade heated words, Sanctum soldiers surround their location.
