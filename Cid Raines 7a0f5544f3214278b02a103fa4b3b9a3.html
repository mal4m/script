In order to free Cocoon from the tyranny of these powerful entities, Raines has begun enlisting the assistance of Fang and the other Pulse l&#x27;Cie.</p><p id="3b595ceb-5c8c-4fad-9c19-803bc5ce0045" class="">

Concealing his l&#x27;Cie status as he continues to lead the Cavalry, Raines pursues his Focus of supporting and guiding Lightning and her companions along the path to Cocoonâ€™s destruction.</p><p id="b5959e78-5bc7-4d4c-bb65-8f9381947411" class="">After defying his Focus and falling in battle against the fugitive l&#x27;Cie, Raines turns to crystal. He is later revived by Barthandelus to serve as the new Primarchâ€”a puppet with the sole purpose of inciting conflict among the people of Cocoon.</p><p id="ff8c946f-c12b-415b-9b1f-daf7bce754af" class="">
