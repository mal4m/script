    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hey.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Hey! Wake up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You've got to wake up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Look!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Hey!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Slow down!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Ready!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Got to keep you kids safe, right?</p></div>





    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Glad that's over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Man, I'm beat.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What, no break?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>They're tracking us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I know that.<br>
    I know that, but we aren't soldiers!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We don't have your kind of stamina.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You've got enough to complain.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Oh, that's&#8212!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Forget it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I think, um...</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I'd stick with her if were you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Later, then.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Come on. Let's get going.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Get going to where, exactly?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>The whole of Cocoon's against us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>No matter how far we run, there's no escape.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>That Cie'th clock, it's still a-tickin'.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>There's still time.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You give up too easy, old man!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I'm not giving up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>But there are some things that you just can't change.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>A kid like you would not understand.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I'm a kid!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>I don't understand!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Well, I guess we can be fugitives together.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You ready?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Ready!</p></div>



    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>End of the road.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>But at least it's not the end of the line!</p></div>





    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>You look dreamy, Farron.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Wishing on fireworks, were you?<br>
    And you call yourself a soldier!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Sorry, Lieutenant.<br>
    But I really don't think guard duty is my calling, sir.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Well, lucky for you, your shift just ended.<br>
    Pack it up and go home.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>But&#8212sir?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>PSICOM found something in the Vestige nearby.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>They don't want the Guardian Corps here<br>
    stepping. on their toes.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>I'm sure you heard about the accident<br>
    at the Euride Gorge energy plant...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>...and how it has the PSICOM lads in a tizzy.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Yeah, more 'incident' than accident.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Something Pulse-related?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>You're taking tomorrow off?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Sir, for my birthday, sir.<br>
    My sister, she insisted on it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Twenty-one, huh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Maybe it's a good time to send off that letter<br>
    of recommendation for officer training.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Lieutenant...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>You're past due for a promotion, Farron.<br>
    Think of your sister, and your future.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>And, uh, keep your nose out of trouble.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Out of PSICOM business, you mean.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Yeah. Nothing good will come of it.<br>
    Nothing but grief.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lt. Amodar</h3>
    <p>Whoa, look at that one!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>How right you were, Lieutenant.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Just you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>For now, I guess.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Should we wait?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>They'll catch up. Eventually.</p></div>






    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Can we get through this way, you think?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You…know where you're going, right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I've been here on missions before.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Missions?<br>
    Nothing to do with the Purge, though?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The Purge is PSICOM's baby.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Our military is split into two arms.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The Public Security and Intelligence Command,<br>
    known as PSICOM...</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I was Guardian Corps, Bodhum Security Regiment.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wait, but l don't get it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>If you're not PSICOM, then why did you board the train?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>For Serah.</p></div>





    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Join the end of the line.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Attention Purge deportees.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Follow instructions, and stay in your lines.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Personal belongings will be returned upon arrival.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Deportee</h3>
    <p>Move it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>You! Halt!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Do not leave your lines!<br>
    This is for your own safety!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>What's the GC doing here?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>What's the GC doing here?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>This op's under PSICOM direction.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>So direct me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Let me on.<br>
    I want to be Purged.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Only civs get Purged.<br>
    Sanctum staff and soldiers are exempt.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Then I quit.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Line up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Excuse me.<br>
    Hey, lady.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What gives?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I volunteered.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Really? You don't look ready to go<br>
    quiet into that good night.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You want quiet, you'd better take the next train.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Well, now really want to see what you're up to.</p></div>

<br>

    <div class="speech"><p><i>I had to rescue Serah before they transported<br>
    the Vestige to Pulse, and out of my reach.</i><p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p><i>My only chance to save her was join the Purge.</i><p></div>


<br>


    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You're telling me you got on that train<br>
    so you could save your sister?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>That's crazy.<br>
    I could never do something like that.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It's not a question of can or can't.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Lightning"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>There are some things in life you just do.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Easy for someone like you to say.</p></div>





    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Lightning!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>She left me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>One, two, three...</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Up we go!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What are you up to?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Wait up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Can't keep up with this girl!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>We made it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Where's Grumpy?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Got left behind, huh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Leave me alone!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>This is pointless.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Can't keep up.<br>
    Can't get home.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It's over for me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>It's <i>not</i> over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>We'll get you home!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I don't have one.<br>
    Now that Mom is&#8212</p></div>



    <div class="speech"><h3>Mother</h3>
    <p>Not making a wish, Hope?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Mom... You still believe in that kind of stuff?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wishing on fireworks? Really?<br>
    That's for little kids.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Mother</h3>
    <p>Who are you calling 'kid'?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You. What did vou wish for?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Mother</h3>
    <p>That next year, your father could come with Us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Why? It's better like this.<br>
    We don't need him.</p></div>

    <br>

    <div class="speech"><p><i>That night, they found the fal'Cie<br>
    in the Bodhum Vestige.</p></i></div>

    <div class="speech"><p><i>The next day, soldiers sealed off the town<br>
    and we couldn't get back to Palumpolum.</p></i></div>

    <br>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>They forced us onto the train with everyone else.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>My mom, she was frantic.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>She wanted to get us home,<br>
    so she tried to fight.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>She got tricked, by Snow.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>He used her!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Let's get you home, okay?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Your dad's got to be worried!</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Let him worry.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Why should care?<br>
    He doesn't.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Any father cares.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Sazh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>It's nothing, forget it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Come with me, okay?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>This ought to do it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We've got time.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We'll get you back home.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Your dad will be happy to see you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Isn't that a&#8212?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>A warship from Pulse.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You mean, they made it this far?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Of course not.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Not during the war, not since.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>They might have tried.<br>
    But none of their forces made it into Cocoon.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>They only damaged the outer rim.<br>
    Then the Sanctum's fal'Cie pushed them back.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What, did you sleep through History?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>More or less.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>So, what's a ship from Pulse doing here?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Once the war was over,<br>
    people couldn't live near the rim anymore.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>In places like the Hanging Edge.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>So the fal'Cie, they gathered up scrap from Pulse,<br>
    and used it for rebuilding here.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Hope"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>This is what was left: a bunch of garbage.</p></div>

    <div class="speech Sazh"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Who'da thunk? A Pulse fal'Cie and who-knows-what,<br>
    mixed in with all the trash?</p></div>

    <div class="speech Vanille"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Who'da thunk...</p></div>

    <br>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Hey, welcome to the party!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You miss us?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Would it kill her to smile?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What is that?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Pulse armament.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>And that's bad for us, isn't it?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You have eyes, don't you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Pulse is crawling with things like that, isn't it?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Got me.<br>
    Not even the Corps has access to intel on Pulse.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Soldiers in the field fight blind.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I noticed that. But don't you need to know<br>
    exactly what you're up against?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Target's a target.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You like to keep it simple, don't you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>stick to my goal.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>As long as you have a goal, you can fight?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You can stay alive.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Not much of a future for us, huh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hard to picture a happy ending.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We don't even know where to go.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>do.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>There.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Eden?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>The Sanctum's seat of power.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Oh, that's a great idea. Just charge right in there.<br>
    Give 'em a taste of l'Cie terror!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You're serious.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Keep running-it's die or turn Cie'th.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>There's no place for l'Cie to hide.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>No... They want a fight?<br>
    Let's take it to the Sanctum's door!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>This isn't a game!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>No.<br>
    That's for damn sure.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It started with Serah.<br>
    The fal'Cie took her.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Now I'm a l'Cie too.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>And the Sanctum's hunting me,<br>
    an enemy of the state.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>But who's pulling their strings?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>A fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Eden.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Cocoon's Sustainer and Guiding Light.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It probably ordered the Purge, too.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Pulse and Sanctum fal'Cie?<br>
    They're all the same.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>And we're all the same to them: expendable.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I'm not dying fal'Cie slave.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>So? What are you gonna do?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Destroy it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>By yourself?<br>
    What, are you crazy?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Say you pull it off...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What's that get you?<br>
    Satisfaction?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Something happens to Eden, it's lights out Cocoon!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You <i>want</i> that.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You're a Pulse l'Cie now,<br>
    so you just want to snuff out Cocoon!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>No!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What about Serah?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>She said to save Cocoon!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>It might even be our Focus to make sure Cocoon stays-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Our Focus doesn't matter.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I don't take orders from fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>How I live is up to me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Don't you mean how you die?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Think like that, and it's already over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Better to pick your path and keep moving.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Don't worry. I'm after the Sanctum.<br>
    I'm not out to destroy the world.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>If it did come to that, wonder if our 'hero'
    would try to stop me?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You want to fight Snow now?<br>
    Just like that, and you're enemies?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Next time we meet, we might be too.</p></div>

    <div class="speech">When the fear sank in, it tore us all apart,</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3> was suffering</p></div>

    <div class="speech">Reaching out to us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech">But none of us could see it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Snow deserves it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech">If only I'd been stronger,<br>
    none of this ever would have happened.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>don't know what I should do.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>That makes two of us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Hey! You're taking care of <i>me</i>.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Well won't be if you keep pushing me like that.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wait for me!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'm going with you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I can't babysit you anymore.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>can fight.<br>
    I'm not afraid.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Great, a PSICOM hit squad.<br>
    L</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Not bad.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Really? Thanks.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Uh-oh. Army's out to play.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What now?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What now?<br>
    Well, we could stay here, but shouldn't we-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Run?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>We should run.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>If we rush in now,<br>
    we'll just get in her way.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You know, you're right.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I guess.<br>
    I mean it's not like Lightning needs any help.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>There will be more soldiers.<br>
    We should keep moving.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Lightning? Are you worried about the others?<br>
    I'm sure they got away okay.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>So can you, if you leave now.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>With me, it'll be fight after fight.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I don't know how it'll end.<br>
    It's anybody's guess.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I know that.<br>
    But-I need to be stronger.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Lightning?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Call me Light.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What's the plan from here?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Through the Gapra Whitewood to Palumpolum.<br>
    We'll find transport to Eden.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I live in Palumpolum.<br>
    I can show you all the shortcuts.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>No side trips.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>No need.<br>
    I don't think l'Cie are welcome at home.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Officer</h3>
    <p>Any trace of the l'Cie?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Soldier</h3>
    <p>Nothing.<br>
    No sign it's been activated.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Officer</h3>
    <p>Who's there?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What was PSICOM doing here?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Probably thought we'd try and use<br>
    a Pulse machine to escape.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Maybe we should try it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What does this do?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself!<br>
    Don't touch that!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wait. What if it works?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Leave It!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I told you to leave it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Stop! Stop already!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I think l got it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Light!<br>
    I think I can work this!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Nice landing.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Let's get moving.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Just need a minute.<br>
    Still a bit winded.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You're too soft.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wait up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>This isn't working.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I mean, you're a liability.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You'll just slow me down.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I'm sorry, but can't protect you when-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You can't leave me here!<br>
    You've got to take me with you!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Enough!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The whole world is against us!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I can barely keep myself alive.<br>
    Let alone some helpless kid!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I don't have time to baby you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You want to get tough?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Do it on your own!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>This cannot be happening.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Look out!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Lightning!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Your brand looks different.<br>
    Was that an Eidolon? Like l'Cie can summon?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Magic and mumbo-jumbo.<br>
    I must've hit my head on that Purge train.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Um...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Am I really in your way?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'll do better! I'll try harder, I'll-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>We'll toughen you up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I'm sorry about before.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>We'll stop here.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Sorry.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Don't sweat it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I'll look around. You rest up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Mom?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Not by a long shot.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>No sign of soldiers.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Guess Lightning got their attention.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>I wonder how Hope's doing.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>They were headed towards Palumpolum.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Kid's on his way home. You can bet on it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Good for him!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What's wrong?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>It's good-if they manage to slip in quietly.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>All of Cocoon is in the grip of Pulse-phobia.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>If a l'Cie pops up on the radar, all hell will break loose.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>They don't even know why they're scared.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Afraid of what they don't know.<br>
    Afraid to find out more.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Gets worse the older you get.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I'm terrified of what will happen.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>The world probably would be better off<br>
    without Pulse l'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I mean, most of them.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Gee, thanks.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Let's go!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We've got to sleep somewhere.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>This look okay?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Uh-yeah!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Fine by me!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>All set.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Okay, good night!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Not a care in the world.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Oh!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Do not cross this line. Understood?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Grow up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>And good night again!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Would you just go to sleep already?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Still a kid...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Couldn't run if you wanted to.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Hoo-hoo-hoo! Look at you!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Wonder what's under the hood of that thing?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Keep your pants on.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>You'd get a peek soon enough.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Just-try and behave.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I'm not gonna make any promises.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Cheeky boy, aren't ya?<br>
    We'll see how long that lasts.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Soldier</h3>
    <p>He's come to meet you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Soldier</h3>
    <p>Halt.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>You must be Snow.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>Cid Raines.<br>
    Brigadier general of the fleet.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Hi, Cid. Thanks for the escort.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>Apologies.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>I just had a few questions to ask you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>If it works like they tell us,<br>
    that means she must have fulfilled her Focus.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Serah!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>Fulfilled her Focus as a tainted Pulse l'Cie, that is.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You think she was out to hurt Cocoon?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>I'd hardly be alone if I did.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>When it comes to Pulse,<br>
    who could claim to know anything?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>I need the truth, for the sake of Cocoon.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>'The sake of Cocoon...'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>We're from Cocoon!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Shipping us out, Purging innocent people...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>That's how you lend us a hand?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>Those are the Sanctum's methods.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>The public fears what it doesn't know.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>It's grown tired of living in constant terror<br>
    of these threats from the world below.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>So, the Sanctum devised a plan for you l'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I'll bet.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>A public execution.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>The people don't know any better.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>Strike down the phantoms before their eyes,<br>
    and they sleep like babes.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>No!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>The Sanctum has intelligence on the other l'Cie already.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>It's only a matter of time.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You'll never catch them.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Raines</h3>
    <p>I see. We'll need your help then, won't we?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Serah….</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You're kidding, right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>I mean it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You can't drop the breakup bomb like that.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Being alone's all right, I guess.<br>
    Yep.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Always was until we met.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>But then we did.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>And now know there's something better:
    being with you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>We've come too far to quit now.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>It's not your choice!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You really want to leave me?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>I don't <i>want</i> to, I have to.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Listen, it's over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Please, just stay away from me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>What happened?<br>
    At least tell me that.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>If it was something did, just say it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Okay.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Look.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Branded by Pulse.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>I'm a l'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>No...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Enemy of Cocoon.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Danger to us all.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Get it now?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>You're my enemy.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Good-bye.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Serah!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Serah, where are you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Serah!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>What is your Focus?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>L'Cie have a Focus, right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I'll go with you. Help you do it.<br>
    Just let me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>No! If you're with me, the Sanctum will-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I will be with you!<br>
    No matter what!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>We've come too far to quit now.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>I don't know.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Not if I'm here.<br>
    I'll protect you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>We'll figure this out-do it together.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Okay?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Okay.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>If it's true what they say...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>We need to hide!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>They don't seem like they're even looking for us.<br>
    I mean, we're l'Cie and we're on the loose.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>PSICOM's keeping it all under wraps.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>They don't want their failure publicized.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Better to lose us than lose their pride.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>So the other soldiers don't know about us. Right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Right. They don't know <i>anything</i> about any fugitives.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I wonder how the others are doing.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Sazh and Vanille?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Who knows?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Even if they got away,<br>
    they'll get caught eventually.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Then they'll have to choose:
    resist or surrender.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Surrender.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>He's too stubborn to die.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>And that's his best quality.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>He's arrogant and chummy from the get-go.<br>
    He thinks he's everybody's pal. Never liked him much.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>He leads around a bunch of kids-gang called 'NORA.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Where'd they get the name 'Nora'?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It's a stupid acronym.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Their little code.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Stands for 'No Obligations, Rules, or Authority.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>

    <p>Civilians aren't allowed in here, are they?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>

    <p>What's eating you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Okay, I can tell you're hung up on something.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>What happened with him?</p></div>

    <p>You wouldn't understand.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You and I are partners, Hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>My mother was killed.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It's his fault.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>And he needs to pay for it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'm not ready yet, but I will be.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Soon.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>That's why I followed you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Snow dragged us all into this.<br>
    You and me, your sister Serah..</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>He's gotta pay.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Could I use one of those?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Bit too heavy for you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Okay.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You became a l'Cie, so now<br>

    <p>Not surprising.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Cute girl like me, it's hard<br>
    to close your eyes, huh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I'm just gonna lie down for a bit.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Being made a l'Cie, it's not easy.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>I mean, look, even I'm kind of worried .</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>But even if we don't know what'll happen,<br>
    we have to keep our dreams alive.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Have something to look forward to, you know?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Next stop is Nautilus, City of Dreams.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Yup.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What? Sazh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Sazh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You scared me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What's up?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I'm just thinking.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Don't blame yourself.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You know, you can't control<br>
    who a fal'Cie picks for a Focus.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>My son Dajh.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>He was picked.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>He's a l'Cie.</p></div>
<br>
    <i><div class="speech"><p>He said he wanted to see a fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>So, I took him to go on a tour of the Euride Gorge plant.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>Thought l'd surprise him with a chocobo chick<br>
    to take home, but the second l turned my back...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>...into the energy plant he went.</p></div></i>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Dajh! Dajh, come out here!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Dajh! I know you're in here!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Dajh! Where are you?<br>
    Say something!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Dajh!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Hey! What's wrong? Dajh!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Dajh</h3>
    <p>Daddy!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>It's all right!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You okay? You're not hurt, are you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>What's that?</p></div>
<br>
<i>    <div class="speech"><p>Apparently, those Pulse l'Cie had snuck in<br>
    and tried to attaok the Sanctum fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>It did the only thing it could,<br>
    and made Dajh a l'Cie to protect it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>My son, he got picked by a Sanctum fal'Cie.<br>
    He's a hero.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>But we're Pulse l'Cie-Dajh's enemies.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>PSICOM showed up right after that<br>
    to take custody of him.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>And then, it was one test after another.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>Even then they couldn't figure out his Focus.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>Maybe it was look for Pulse l'Cie,<br>
    maybe it was kill 'em.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>Either way...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><p>...how could a kid that young even stand a chance?</p></div></i>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>After he was made a l'Cie, Dah had<br>
    some way of sensing things from Pulse.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>He was the one who found the Pulse fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>But the kid can't fight.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>So, that's why I put myself<br>
    on the train to Purgeville.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>I figured his Focus had to have something<br>
    to do with destroying that Pulse fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Thought I could could do it for him, and, well...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You know the rest.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>If I was right about his Focus,<br>
    he's probably a crystal already.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Of course, if he was supposed<br>
    to take out that thing's l'Cie...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>...then either we die, or he's a Cie'th.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Die? Really?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>It's a pickle all right.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>But the bird-the bird says no.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Whoa!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>A device that makes bad weather.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Come out to play in the rain, did you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Hmph. Isn't that adorable?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Uh-oh.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>That's not good.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>What do we do?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>All right, I got it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We sneak.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Right.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Just too much to ask to cut me<br>
    one break, isn't it?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Come and get it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>A hop, skip, and a jump,<br>
    and we're in Nautilus.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>The 'City of Dreams'...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>We can board the ship over there.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>When it rains around here, it pours.<br>
    And then it rains some more.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Sazh... Do you hate Pulse?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Why wouldn't I?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Look at this mess it's gotten us all into!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Of course, that's not to say I always hated it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Seemed fishy. All that Sanctum ranting<br>
    about the 'threat from Pulse.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>'Only a matter of time before they strike.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>'Pulse is infested with monsters.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Scare after scare, and not even a shred of proof.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Tired old cynics like me,<br>
    we don't just swallow that tabloid crap.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>No, no. Not me. I figured the Sanctum<br>
    was up to something crooked.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>At least until I got dragged in.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Yeah...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Now that I think about it, all this Purge business...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>...it really only happened because<br>
    Dajh found tha Pulse fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>You're wrong.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>Don't blame him. It was all-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>Yeah, you're right.<br>
    It was that scum from Pulse behind it.</p></div>
<br>
    <i><div class="speech"><p>I might as well have tried to stop the rain.<br>
    I fought the tears...</p></div></i>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Sazh</h3>
    <p>You're getting soaked.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>I'll be fine!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Vanille</h3>
    <p>It's only water.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Attention all units.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>This is Director Rosch, PSICOM division.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Cocoon is caught in the grip of a Pulse-born terror.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>If we allow l'Cie activity to continue,<br>
    panic will rip our world apart.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>The peace and stability we have fought<br>
    so hard to maintain will be nothing but a memory.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Pulse l'Cie threaten our very way of life.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>They must be eliminated.<br>
    There can be no hesitation.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>That is all.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>If we fail, our citizens will pay the price.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>Task Force reporting.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Officer</h3><br>
    <p>Begin operations immediately.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>Sir!</p></div>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>We can make it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Get to the station, and board the train for Eden.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You think it's still running?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Well, if it isn't, we'll make it run.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Then punch straight into the heart of the Sanctum?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Now you're thinking like a Pulse l'Cle.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Well, this is Operation Nora.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It's not just Snow I'm after.<br>
    The Sanctum's got to pay too.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Hey, you're the one who said we had to fight.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Every minute we waste, we're tempting fate.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>There's some underground tunnels not far from here.<br>
    I used to play in them when was a kid.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>No one uses the entrance anymore,<br>
    so even the army doesn't know about it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>But I know where it is.<br>
    We can sneak in under their noses.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Sounds good.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Great! Here we go.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Huh. No more rivalries now.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>PSICOM's brought in the Guardian Corps.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Okay, there's an old drainage pipe.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>We can use it to avoid being seen.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>The tunnel entrance is a little further up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Don't worry, it will be fine.<br>
    Only kids like me know about that entrance.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>They'll find it. They'll call in a team,<br>
    and canvass the whole tunnel system.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Then we'd better hurry.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>So, where's this thing come out, anyway?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Well, it...I don't really know for sure.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>We'll find out today.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Name's Carbuncle.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>That's one of our enemies, being Sanctum and all.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>So...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Kill him, and cut off the food supply.<br>
    That'll make us popular.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I think people have enough reason to hate us,<br>
    don't you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Yeah, you're probably right.<br>
    Hungry people make for angry people.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Look at us: Pulse l'Cie, using a Sanctum fal'Cie<br>
    to tell where we're going. Sort of strange.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Not really.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>We've relied on them our whole lives.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The food we eat, the light and water,<br>
    it's all from the fal'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You know, I think Cocoon was really built for them.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The rest of us, we're just leeches. Parasites.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You think?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>They protect us, nurture us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>They take care of, well, normal people.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>They treat us like we're special, almost like...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Like we're pets!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Like pets.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>To them, we are just pets.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>That's it.<br>
    Now it makes sense.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I've been so blind.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>was born into a fal'Cie world,<br>
    raised on a fal'Cie leash.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It was the only life I knew how to live.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>When it was taken from me,<br>
    I was completely lost.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Without a master to follow,<br>
    my life had no purpose.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hope, listen to me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>This l'Cie curse, it took everything from me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>My future. My dreams.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I didn't want to think.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>So I fought instead.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>As long as was fighting, nothing else was real.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I was running away.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>And you, Hope...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You got swept along with me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>But Lightning, I don't understand.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Operation Nora is over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>No!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You told me to fight!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I made a mistake!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>But-you can't do this.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You can't just build something up like that,<br>
    then abandon me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I won't abandon you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I won't.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>So what do we do now?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>We're l'Cie! Ticking time bombs.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Enemies of Cocoon.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>If We can't follow the plan,<br>
    do we just lay down and die?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I didn't mean we should give up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Then what battles do we fight?<br>
    And against who? Tell me that!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I don't know yet.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You don't know yet?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>That's right. I don't know yet.<br>
    But do know we can't lose hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Hope?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>There is no hope.<br>
    Not for l'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>There's you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It's my name, not who am.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I was just like you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>My parents died.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I had to be strong for Serah,<br>
    so I thought I needed to forget my past.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>And I became Lightning.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I thought that by changing my name,<br>
    I could change who I was.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I was just a kid.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Lightning.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It flashes bright, then fades away.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It can't protect. It only destroys.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Serah tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen.</p></div>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>There you are.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>If you really are a l'Cie,<br>
    it's my job to deal with you.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Typical.</p></div>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I threatened her.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Come on, slowpoke!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Sorry. Got held up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Serah</h3>
    <p>Where have you been?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I'm really late, huh?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>The only one who believed her was Snow.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Don't say it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Don't say his name.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It brings everything back.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>keep playing it in my head,<br>
    what happened to her.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>And then see his stupid face and...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>...and he's smiling.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>How can he smile when she's dead?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I know!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>There's nothing can do about it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I hate knowing that. No matter what<br>
    happens, she's not coming back!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>When l was fighting,<br>
    there was no time to think about it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It felt good just to give in.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>But now you start talking about hope...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'm sorry. I'm messed up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>No...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It's my fault.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Talk to your dad.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>What? Why?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Fighting without hope is no way to live.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>It's just a way to die.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I want you to find the hope you were named for.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Staying alive, I can help you with.<br>
    But I can't-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I can't give you hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>If you go to see your father...</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You think meeting my dad<br>
    will make anything better?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>He's never listened to a word I've said.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>He's just-he'll never believe all this l'Cie stuff.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Snow believed Serah, didn't he?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Yeah.</p></div>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Reporter</h3>
    <i><p>In a recently convened emergency conference...</p></i></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Reporter</h3>
    <i><p>...the Sanctum announced that<br>
    the fugitive l'Cie have been located.</p></i></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Reporter</h3>
    <i><p>The military plans to apprehend the l'Cie<br>
    and carry out a public execution.</p></i></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Reporter</h3>
    <i><p>These images coming to you live<br>
    from the scene in Palumpolum.</p></i></div>
<br>
    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>These are l'Cie. Show no mercy.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>They aren't people. They're targets.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Start running.<br>
    I'll keep 'em busy.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>But-!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>You survive.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>That's some crowd.<br>
    Gonna need a plan.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Since when have heroes ever needed plans?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Fang!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>It's him!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Move! Take us up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Yeah!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Lightning!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Take care of him.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Lightning, listen to me!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Get moving!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>No, you don't understand!<br>
    Serah's all right! She'll turn back!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Take care of Hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Wait!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>And then there were three.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>They're here!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Hold it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Gotta go!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>So how've you been?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Hang on!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>PSICOM Soldier</h3>
    <p>Fire! Fire!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>One's down!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Take cover!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I got this one!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>What's up?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Where have you been?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I got taken in.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Wait-what?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Not by enemies.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>It was the Cavalry, not PSICOM.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Leader's name is Raines.<br>
    He said he'd lend us l'Cie a hand.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>So now, your hero is back!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Why would the army help us?<br>
    That doesn't make sense.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Military's got all kinds.<br>
    Not all of 'em like the Sanctum.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Don't worry. I'll handle the bad guys.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Come on.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>You've changed, haven't you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Seems like you've toughened up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'm a l'Cie. I had to.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>The only ones that ought to be fighting the army<br>
    are us dumb grown-ups.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>You think it's stupid to fight?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>It is if you get killed.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Anyway, just lay low.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Let the dummies duke it out.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>The army's no match for NORA, right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>He was...he was <i>smiling!</i></p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>It's me, what's up?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>You damn well know what's up!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Why haven't you called in?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Sorry, slipped my mind.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Right... What's your status?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Great, great! Hope's great too!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Are you all right?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>I'm great, you're great, everybody's great.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Reunion time.<br>
    Figure out a rendezvous point.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Don't sweat it.<br>
    That line's hyper-encrypted.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Hey, Sis. Is that you?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>I'm not your sister.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>This city's under our jurisdiction.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>Were the ones defending it!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>We should have a say in what's done to protect it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Attention all units.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Ignore all fire zone restrictions.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Fire at will.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>What?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Whatever it takes to kill the l'Cie.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Over.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>'Whatever it takes'?<br>
    You want to start a war in the streets?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>Civilians are still evacuating!<br>
    The collateral we're talking about is unacceptable!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>GC Soldier</h3>
    <p>You don't know what it's like out there!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p><i>You</i> don't understand why we're here.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>Who do you think it is, terrified of Pulse<br>
    and begging us to kill the l'Cie?</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>It's not the Sanctum.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>It's not us.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Rosch</h3>
    <p>It's the people.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>We'll meet at Hope's place.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Felix Heights 35-A.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Right. See ya there.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>Tell Fang 'hey.'</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Take care of Hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>All over it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>And I'll tell you more about Serah<br>
    when we meet up.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>I found out she can turn back.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Snow</h3>
    <p>There's still hope.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Snow.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Listen to me. It's about Hope.<br>
    His mother was-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>Lightning, it's me.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I decided- <i>(static)</i></p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>-I have to- <i>(static)</i> -Operation-</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hope? Hope!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Answer me!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Hope</h3>
    <p>I'm sorry.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Lightning</h3>
    <p>Hope!</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>Yelling doesn't fix it.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>It's called interference.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>You can chitchat when we get there.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>I've got point, you fall in behind.</p></div>

    <div class="speech"><h3>Fang</h3>
    <p>And see if you can't cool off<br>
    that head of yours.</p></div>
