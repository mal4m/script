Acting as a bridge between the fal&#x27;Cie Eden and a citizen-elected council, he facilitates the government of Cocoon.</p><p id="ea2b2bc5-f7bd-4df6-b24a-618617203b4d" class="">Until now, he has been seen as a conservative leader, never forcing the direction of the council, and always having the best interests of the people at heart. But with the discovery of the Pulse fal&#x27;Cie in Bodhum, his leadership becomes ruthless and oppressive, with the Purge policy being instigated over the span of a single night.</p><p id="b3812459-5a7d-40b2-b010-745c818881d1" class="">
