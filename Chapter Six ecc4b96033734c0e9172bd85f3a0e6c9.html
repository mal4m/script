Reasoning that it would be best to put as much distance between themselves and the army as possible, she suggests heading in the opposite directionâ€”towards the city of Nautilus.</p><p id="0568987c-1757-4f98-872c-5352b1c7eec1" class="">And so Vanille skips off through the dappled shade of the Sunleth Waterscape, only too eager to put danger behind them once more.</p><figure id="4f4d562a-f51b-41a2-98f3-95eac5dafc86" class="image"><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/f/f9/VanilleFlowers.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20160311145529"><img style="width:1000px" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/f/f9/VanilleFlowers.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20160311145529"/></a></figure><h1 id="7939002b-cbb4-4161-bd75-9427897f9e4a" class="">A Wish for Daddy</h1><p id="1ab93bff-46e0-40ef-9fe6-321ed139c307" class="">Sazh and Vanille make their way through the Sunleth Waterscape, trying to distance themselves from the Sanctum forces assembling in the city of Palumpolum.</p><p id="58332757-2e56-459d-8e29-8f2f1f93cc7e" class="">Vanille&#x27;s offhand question about family fills Sazh&#x27;s head with memories of his son, Dajh...</p><p id="72245685-6ed3-4433-896f-5ad7976afee0" class="">As fireworks illuminated the night sky with brilliant color, Dajh had made a wish out of concern for his dad.

Now a Sanctum l&#x27;Cie with the ability to sense the presence of Pulsian energies, Dajh has been held in custody and monitored by government officials ever since.</p><p id="984618dc-7a05-452d-b101-0d74e28fdd64" class="">It is thanks to Dajh&#x27;s unique ability that PSICOM was able to discover the Pulse fal&#x27;Cie in Bodhum. However, with his exact Focus yet to be determined, the boy is doomed to become a Cie&#x27;th.</p><p id="27ce046b-69ff-4f98-a5af-1e5978c94c02" class="">This is what prompted Sazh to board the Purge train. Guessing that Dajh&#x27;s Focus might be to destroy the Pulse fal&#x27;Cie, Sazh seized the only means available to him to reach the accursed creature before it could be carried to the world below. If he could slay it somehow, he reasoned, he might just be able to save his son.</p><p id="b956b942-563c-48ad-9cb8-ea3b1110216f" class="">So, now that the Pulse fal&#x27;Cie is no more, has Dajh gone through the same crystal transformation as Serah? Or was his Focus not to rid the world of the fal&#x27;Cie, but of the l&#x27;Cie servants it created?</p><p id="34dd6944-9400-43a0-9a6d-ca2715351a63" class="">If that is the case, then Sazh and his companions must die to spare Dajh a fate worse than death.</p><figure id="68449308-4817-481e-8aad-79bf9d787efa" class="image"><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/d/d6/Dajh_branded.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20141012183326"><img style="width:1000px" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/d/d6/Dajh_branded.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20141012183326"/></a></figure><h1 id="23e9a61d-42e5-4de0-b3c4-4a01124d2162" class="">Chain of Events</h1><p id="d52a50fc-055f-463f-86dd-c92a1292b5c5" class="">Sazh&#x27;s son, Dajh, was branded a Sanctum l&#x27;Cie when he stumbled into the midst of a Pulse attack on the Euride Gorge energy plant.</p><p id="0168d32b-2ecc-4d74-9420-1ed7699abfd3" class="">With the help of the l&#x27;Cie powers Dajh gained during the incident, the military discovered the Pulse fal&#x27;Cie in Bodhum, instigating the Purge. In the ensuing violence, Hope lost his mother, and Lightning and Snow witnessed Serah&#x27;s transformation into crystal.</p><p id="c06e18ee-ac1d-4a2e-8f9c-cf087f7973d0" class="">The whole series of events that has thrown their lives into chaos and threatens even now to shatter Cocoon&#x27;s peaceful society can be traced back to Euride.</p><p id="36b25608-def3-454b-b91e-a3198c1b8d8a" class="">Had that incident never occurred, could these tragedies have been avoided?
